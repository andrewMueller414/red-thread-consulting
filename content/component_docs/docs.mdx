- No special characters in field names. The `name` field can be any string so long as it does not contain special characters (characters other than letters, numbers and white-space).
  - This field is used as the 'key' for this field in the database, so it must be unique and never change once the form is created.
  - Make it as descriptive as you like. This will be displayed as the title for the field in the results, but is visible only to administrators.
- Line breaks are only allowed in jsx strings started with a backtick quotation (top left of keyboard). There is a list of a few more requirements of strings that are used in jsx, the 'x' in mdx. There are no such requirements for markdown content.
  - 'jsx' is what goes between the opening `<` and closing `>` described below. Everything else is markdown.
- Copy and paste the components as needed, and just modify their properties. The documentation of each component here is more of a reference than a guide. Maybe explore the existing components now so improvements can be made, but worry about the details as they're needed.
- Because the `name` field is used as an identifier, there's some weird behavior in the editor. Whenever you change this field, make sure to save it, reload the editor, and then save it again. The only alternative to enforcing this type of behavior is to require another property that truly never changes.
</Callout>

### Some notes on the workflow:

- You can add images to AWS from the administrator's media page. Clicking on an image there will open a modal with a url at the bottom. Clicking this url will copy it to your clipboard, where it can be pasted into either markdown's own image syntax or into the url property of the `Image` component.
  - You can use any image url with either the markdown image syntax or the image component, so long as the url points directly to an image.

## Editor

**Use ⌥+s (option+s) to save**. This is ***required*** or all data will be lost. Since this writes data to the database this is not done automatically to keep operational costs as low as possible.

Mdx is a superset of markdown, a combination of [React's](https://react.dev/) `jsx` language with markdown, the (ironically, 'markup' language) that's used in apps like [Notion](https://www.notion.com/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).  

Mdx gets parsed to html, which can be styled to blend in and function along with our existing application. There's a solid breakdown of the default markdown elements [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and how they convert to html, along with examples of all of the syntax. Before the jsx is even added, there are multiple popular 'flavors' of markdown, with the 'github flavor' being the most popular with added support for things like footnotes. All Github Flavored Markdown features are enabled in this application. 

With the addition of jsx to markdown however, a developer can write components that interact with the entire application that also compile to html, but in a more complex way. This uses a special `jsx` syntax. I'll do my best to cover what I think isn't obvious from the examples here.

### Jsx

Components will always start with a capital letter, be one word, and will never include any special characters. To call a component, you use an opening `<` bracket followed by the component's name, a list of properties that is unique to each component type, and a set of closing brackets. There are actually two types of closing brackets, with the only difference being if the component is being passed any 'children'. 

`children` is just a special property that represents things that go inside of the parent. A big part of why `jsx` was created was to more easily model this `children` property in a way that aligns with the way we naturally organize this type of property in our heads, making things much easier to read, but in the end this `children` property is just like any other property, only implemented in a different way.  Think of a layout component like our `Align` component. This component doesn't render anything on it's own, although that's not a strict requirement of components that accept `children`, but it changes the position of the components that are inside of it; this is when developers usually choose to represent a property as a 'child'.

**Remember:** Sometimes the children property will be just regular markdown, other times it might be expecting a specific type of children like a specific component or a specific number of children to implement the intended layout. If that's the case that will be noted with the component's examples below. This type of error will not cause an issue with the computer and will possibly go unnoticed, but it can cause unintended layouts at different screen sizes.

If a component accepts a child, it is written as:

```tsx
<MyComponent>
The children in this case will be a paragraph of text that says 'The children....'
</MyComponent>
```

If does is not, you don't need the second instance of it's name and you can just write as follows. This is common for things like inputs where nothing really belongs inside of it.


```tsx
<MyComponent />
```


### Providing Properties

There are a handful of different types of properties you can provide to mdx components, but they'll be documented here only if they actually occur in our components.


#### String

This is the most common, and unfortunately the only one that's even remotely challenging. Since the 'x' in mdx is really just 'jsx', it's required to know a little about how javascript handles strings. The key points are:

1. You can use any quotation mark, so long as you use the same quotation mark to both open and close the string.
2. Wrapping the value, including the quotation marks with curly brackets `{}` is optional for both `'` and `"`, but is required for `\``
3. Using the back-tick, `\`` (top left of keyboard) gives slightly more freedom, allowing for the use of multiple lines
4. If you really _need_ to include the same quotation mark that you're using to open and close the string within the string itself, you need to escape it with a leading `\` character. This ends up looking like `"This is my \"quote\" within a string"`

#### Boolean

A boolean is just a `true` or `false` value. To make things even more simple, a property is most often assumed to be false, and is automatically set to true if you don't assign a value, so just writing the property name is the same as setting it to true. This means that 

```tsx
<Checkbox 
    initiallyChecked={true}
  />
```

and

```tsx
<Checkbox 
    initiallyChecked
  />
```

are the same thing, where as just removing the `initiallyChecked` all together assumes the value is false.

#### Arrays

Arrays are just ordered lists of some other type in javascript. They're written with a pair of square brackets `[]` with a list of comma-separated values as they would be written elsewhere. For an array of strings that means the same string that quotation rules apply, and the same for the object notation below.

#### Objects

Objects are a part of javascript and are just a group of properties that all represent the same thing in some sense. They're a set of key-value pairs, where the key and value are seperated by a colon, and each key-value pair is separated by a comma. The `ReorderInput` component accepts a list of options that is an array of objects with the properties `title`, `subtitle` and `value`.

This is written as:

```tsx 
options={[
    {
        title: "Option 1",
        value: "1"
    }, // Notice the comma here.
    {
        title: "Option 2", // and the commas here.
        subtitle: "Option 2 has an optional subtitle",
        value: "2"
    }
]}
```

While the spacing within the string will appear as white space within that string, the pretty indentation is completely optional.

# Components

Jsx is a language developed initially by Facebook for it's portability and readability. It can become quite complicated as it's just a superset of a regular programming language, javascript. While complicated in it's entirety, any capable developer should be able to wrap complex layouts in a set of simple, easy to use properties, making the actual usage of those components almost as simple as markdown.

## Input Components

For stylistic reasons, the `maxWidth` property is only applied when the viewport is wide enough. Below this width everything will collapse to being full-width and a single column to accommodate the smaller viewport.


### Text Input

```tsx
<TextInput 
    label={`My Label`}
    // This 'name' field is associated with this value in the database.
    // What matters most is that it is unique,
    // and that it never changes once a user has inserted data.
    name={"anyUniqueNameThatNeverChanges"}
    // This placeholder field is optional.
    placeholder="Company Name"
    // "small" | "medium" | "large" | "full"
    // If none provided, default is "full"
    width="large"
/>
```

Produces:


<TextInput 
    label={`My Label`}
    name={"anyUniqueNameThatNeverChanges"}
    placeholder="Company Name"
    width="large"
/>



### Multiline Input

All of the properties here are the same as in the `EmbeddableTextInput` component.

```tsx
<MultiLineTextInput
    label={`My Label`}
    name={"anyUniqueNameThatNeverChanges2"}
    placeholder="Tell me more..."
    // "small" | "medium" | "large" | "full"
    // If none provided, default is "full"
    width="medium"
    // The number of rows to make the input. 
    // The input is resizable, but this will be
    // it's initial size
    // defaults to 3 if not present.
    rows={3}
/>
```


<MultiLineTextInput
    label={`My Label`}
    name={"anyUniqueNameThatNeverChanges2"}
    placeholder="Tell me more..."
    rows={3}
    width="medium"
/>


### Checkbox Input

For boolean questions like 'should I contact you by email', you can use a checkbox. 

```tsx
<Checkbox
    name="My name that never changes"
    title="My title"
    subtitle="This subtitle is optional." 
/>
```


<Checkbox name="My name that never changes" title="My title" subtitle="This subtitle is optional." />


### Select Input

For choosing a single item from a list.


```tsx
<SelectInput
    name="Preferred contact method"
    options={[
        "Email",
        "Phone",
        "Text",
    ]}
    label="Contact Method"
    // This is the default placeholder.
    placeholder="Search..."
    // "small" | medium" | "large" | "full""
    // Default: "medium"
    width="medium"
/>
```


<SelectInput
    name="Preferred contact method"
    options={[
        "Email",
        "Phone",
        "Text",
    ]}
    label="Contact Method"
    placholder="Search..."
    width="medium"
/>


### Date-Time Input

**With Time:**

```tsx
<DateInput 
    name="My unique descriptive name"
    time
    // Any theme color can be passed in as a boolean.
    // Default: "matcha"
    dust
/>
```

You can include `time` to show a time component. 

<DateInput 
    name="My unique descriptive name"
    time
    matcha
    marginBottom="medium"
/>


<DateInput 
    name="My unique descriptive name"
    time
    marginBottom="medium"
    cream
/>

<DateInput 
    name="My unique descriptive name"
    time
    marginBottom="medium"
    dust
/>

<DateInput 
    name="My unique descriptive name"
    time
    marginBottom="medium"
    fog
/>

<DateInput 
    name="My unique descriptive name"
    time
    marginBottom="medium"
    mist
/>

<DateInput 
    name="My unique descriptive name"
    time
    marginBottom="medium"
    moss
/>

<DateInput 
    name="My unique descriptive name"
    time
    marginBottom="medium"
    pine
/>




**Without Time:**

```tsx
<DateInput 
    name="My unique descriptive name two"
    // Any of the theme colors can be applied as a boolean.
    // Default: dust
    mist
    // Completely optional, just using for spacing.
    marginBottom="medium"
/>
```

If you remove the `time` property only the button is shown.

<DateInput 
    name="My unique descriptive name two 1"
    matcha
    marginBottom="medium"
/>


<DateInput 
    name="My unique descriptive name two 2"
    cream
    marginBottom="medium"
/>

<DateInput 
    name="My unique descriptive name two 3"
    dust
    marginBottom="medium"
/>

<DateInput 
    name="My unique descriptive name two 4"
    fog
    marginBottom="medium"
/>

<DateInput 
    name="My unique descriptive name two 5"
    mist
    marginBottom="medium"
/>

<DateInput 
    name="My unique descriptive name two 6"
    moss
    marginBottom="medium"
/>

<DateInput 
    name="My unique descriptive name two 7"
    pine
    marginBottom="medium"
/>

This accepts a set of other properties:

| Key | Type | Default Value |
| --- | ---- | ------------- |
| dateLabel | string | "Date" |
| datePlaceholder | string | "Select date" |
| timeLabel | string | "Time" |
| time | boolean | false |

And then also one of the following two:

Here, the `past` and `future` keys, if set to true will collect dates for 10 years forward (future) or 100 years backwards (past).

| Key | Type | Default Value |
| --- | ---- | ------------- |
| past | boolean | false |
| future | boolean | false |

Or you can set the years explicitly:

| Key | Type | Default Value |
| --- | ---- | ------------- |
| toYear | number | undefined |
| fromYear | number | undefined |


### Reorder Input

```tsx
<ReorderInput 
    name="myUniqueUnchangingName"
    // An optional title.
    title="A title is optional"
    // An optionl subtitle.
    subtitle="A subtitle is optional too!"
    // The theme color to apply when not dragging.
    // Default: matcha
    color="matcha"
    // The theme color to apply when dragging.
    // Default: cream
    drag="cream"
    // A required array of options with the fields:
    // title: string
    // value: string | number (must be unique)
    // subtitle: optional string
    options={[
        {
            title: "Option 1",
            // This can be either a string or a number.
            // This is the value that will be stored in the
            // database and visible only to admins.
            value: 1 
        },  
        {
            title: "Option 2",
            subtitle: "Subtitles are optional",
            // Make sure the same value doesn't appear twice
            // in the same list.
            value: 2
        },
        {
            title: "Option 3",
            subtitle: "Subtitles are optional",
            value: 3
        },
    ]}
/>
```


<ReorderInput 
    name="myUniqueUnchangingName"
    title="A title is optional"
    subtitle="A subtitle is optional too!"
    color="matcha"
    drag="cream"
    options={[
        {
            title: "Option 1",
            // This can be either a string or a number.
            // This is the value that will be stored in the
            // database and visible only to admins.
            value: 1 
        },  
        {
            title: "Option 2",
            subtitle: "Subtitle's are optional",
            // Make sure the same value doesn't appear twice
            // in the same list.
            value: 2
        },
        {
            title: "Option 3",
            subtitle: "Subtitle's are optional",
            value: 3
        },
    ]}
/>

### Slider

For a number value that belongs in a range, you can use a slider input.

```tsx
<SliderInput
    name="My unique name for this slider"
    // Default: 0
    min={0}
    // Optional, if undefined will default to half-way.
    initial={5}
    // Default: 1
    max={10}
    // Default: 0.1
    step={0.1}
    // Optional, Default: undefined
    label="How important is this to you?"
    // Whether or not to show value of slider below.
    // Default: false
    showValue
    // "small" | "medium" | "large" | "full"
    // Default: "medium"
    width={"medium"}
    // If showValue is true, this is the 
    // number of decimals to round the value to.
    // Default: 1
    decimals={1}
    // Any of the theme colors can be applied
    // as a boolean.
    mist
/>
```

<SliderInput
    name="My unique name for this slider 1"
    min={0}
    max={10}
    step={0.1}
    label="This is a 'dust' slider"
    showValue
    width={"medium"}
    dust
/>

<SliderInput
    name="My unique name for this slider 2"
    min={0}
    max={10}
    step={0.1}
    label="This is a 'moss' slider"
    showValue
    width={"medium"}
    moss
/>
<SliderInput
    name="My unique name for this slider 3"
    min={0}
    max={10}
    step={0.1}
    label="This is a 'pine' slider"
    showValue
    width={"medium"}
    pine
/>
<SliderInput
    name="My unique name for this slider 4"
    min={0}
    max={10}
    step={0.1}
    label="This is a 'mist' slider"
    showValue
    width={"medium"}
    mist
/>
<SliderInput
    name="My unique name for this slider 5"
    min={0}
    max={10}
    step={0.1}
    label="This is a 'fog' slider"
    showValue
    width={"medium"}
    fog
/>
<SliderInput
    name="My unique name for this slider 6"
    min={0}
    max={10}
    step={0.1}
    label="This is a 'matcha' slider"
    showValue
    width={"medium"}
    matcha
/>

<SliderInput
    name="My unique name for this slider 7"
    min={0}
    max={10}
    step={0.1}
    label="This is a 'cream' slider"
    showValue
    width={"medium"}
    cream
/>


### Submit

This is a simple button that submits the form, but has several useful properties. Below are the default values. All properties are optional, so it can just be written as `<Submit />` if the defaults are ok. You can also pass any theme color as a boolean, and an `icon` field that is any [lucide icon](https://lucide.dev/icons/) name to display an icon alongside the text.

```tsx
<Submit 
    // The text content of the button.
    label={"Submit"}
    // The notification if the submission
    // is successful.
    notificationTitle={"Thank you"}
    notificationBody={"Form submitted successfully"}
    // The notification if the submission
    // encounters an error.
    notificationErrorTitle={"Oh no."}
    notificationErrorBody={"An error occurred. Someone will address this as soon as possible."}
/>
```

On the editor page, this component will print out the form's data to the browser's developer console (cmd+opt+i in chrome) instead of writing it to the database.


## Layout Components

Remember to consider the width of the preview when viewing these layout components, as much of their intended functionality is to respond to different screen sizes.


### Card

A 'card' is a component that adds a border, title, an optional subtitle and some padding around it's children. Here is a set of examples applying each of the theme colors to the following component.

```tsx
<Card 
    title="This is a pine card"
    subtitle="Velit odio metus laoreet non aenean vivamus eleifend in nec."
    pine
>

    columns={{

        medium: 1,
        large: 2
    }}
    // This will reverse the order of things when the grid collapses to 
    // a single column. This is necessary to achieve certain alternating layouts.
    reverse

    <Align>

    <Align>

    </Align>
</Grid>



### ColoredGridSection 


The section that appears on the Red Thread Consulting landing page was not replicated exactly as components that span the full width of the screen require some reasonably complex properties to style for all screensizes. Instead there exists something similar, hopefully adding the ability to add some color contrast to various sections.

Set `reverse` to true to flip the image and the content.



```tsx
<ColoredGridSection 
    img="https://red-thread-consulting-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/78ed74e7-98b6-49e3-87df-7d13e5dd8f0b"
    imgAlt="A big tree in the forest."
    title="For that moment when the old definition of success no longer fits…"
    // "cormorant" | "mono" | "ss-pro"
    // Default: cormorant
    titleFont="cormorant"
    subtitle="Red Thread consulting exists to help you choose what comes next."
    width="full"
    // Any of the theme colors can be
    // applied as a boolean.

### Align

By default, the `Align` component will try to center things within it's parent, but there are many other layouts that can be achieved with this component.

It accepts the following properties:

| Property | Options | Default |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| vertical | "top", "bottom", "center" | "center" |
| horizontal | "left", "right", "center" | "center" |
| width | "fit", "full" | "full" |

Leaving the properties empty will apply all of the defaults, centering the content as in the example above.


## General UI Components

### Image

Markdown has it's own image syntax, `![Some descriptive text](linkToImageHere)`, but there is also a much more powerful component available. The natively supported markdown images inserted with the syntax mentioned previously are styled to not completely ruin the style of the application, but it's not possible to style a component for every use case. That's where jsx's properties excel. The image component has several properties, many of which are optional, but you're almost always going to want to apply a `maxWidth` property and either a `left` or a `right` property for most vertical layouts.



| Property | Options | Default |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| url | any string (the url of the image) | Required property |
| alt | any string | Required property |
| maxWidth | "small", "medium", "large" or any number | undefined |
| maxHeight | "small", "medium", "large" or any number | undefined |
| left | true, false | false |
| right | true, false | false |

Here, the `left` property 'floats' the image to the left when the screen is large enough, wrapping text around the image. `right` of course does the same thing on the other side. The `alt` property is some alternative text to display for people with visual disabilities and search engines, and the `url` property is the url of the image itself. The only two properties that are required are `url` and `alt`, but when the component is not wrapped in another layout component, you'll almost always want to use `maxWidth` and either `left` or `right`.


#### An example with some lorem ipsum text to demonstrate text wrapping

This is some example text wrapping around an image with the following content:

```tsx
<Image 
    // picsum is a random image provider,
    // this app has the ability to provide your 
    // own via AWS. See the media page...
   url={"https://picsum.photos/200/300?grayscale"}
   alt="Some alternative description here."
   maxWidth="medium"
   left
/>
```

Pharetra integer nulla volutpat pharetra convallis tristique magna nulla cursus. Nec morbi nunc arcu, a eu eget ut at diam. Dignissim pretium ut, porttitor lacus convallis diam, elit lectus id. Imperdiet nisl id dictum dictum, vulputate, vestibulum facilisis sed nullam. Ultricies laoreet consectetur est amet turpis, lectus consectetur cursus velit.

<Image 
   url={"https://picsum.photos/200/300?grayscale"}
   alt="Some alternative description here."
   maxWidth="medium"
   left
/>

Tempor maximus dignissim viverra sed eu aliquet, massa platea porta. Convallis eget pretium amet sed aliquam ligula aliquam porta in. Turpis libero condimentum sed ac congue ac luctus auctor sed. Risus metus montes, ornare laoreet ut hac, ultrices ultricies risus. Nisl et velit velit, nibh ornare urna tincidunt dictumst enim.

Erat, consectetur, nec faucibus gravida id sed aenean elit rhoncus. In lorem lobortis consectetur vel iaculis et adipiscing, eu etiam. Nisl montes lacus praesent, nunc ultrices eget praesent ipsum vulputate. Quis ut diam a praesent pellentesque dictumst pharetra volutpat, tempor. Posuere laoreet metus et nibh at eget nullam efficitur nunc.

Sit id massa ac nibh velit phasellus, condimentum vel, suscipit. Diam duis porta massa dignissim ut dui laoreet convallis augue. Placerat proin eget, ac arcu tristique lacus pharetra elit suscipit. Convallis vestibulum nullam luctus, faucibus amet praesent in consectetur tempor. Tristique porta, nullam faucibus diam in nisl sed efficitur ipsum.

Ullamcorper id, dignissim iaculis ante faucibus varius, venenatis metus praesent. At aliquam, ligula purus augue nibh at malesuada risus, bibendum. Tristique vulputate laoreet nisi, dui faucibus quis, diam purus et. Aenean eget dui elit quam congue id, elementum, cursus ac. Dignissim ut convallis imperdiet, aliquam id dignissim tincidunt dignissim ligula.

<Title 
    title="Title"
    subtitle="A title component with some additional functionality."
    depth={3}
    font="ss-pro"
    width="full"
/>

Along with the default markdown → html headings, there is also a title component that adds a few additional properties.

To set the font of the title, you can use the `font` property set to one of "ss-pro", "cormorant", or "mono" (monospaced font). There also exists a `subtitle` property that is an optional string, that if applied, will appear below the title with the padding more appropriately spaced. There is also a `depth` property that can be set to a number 1-6 to indicate the depth of the title. This is equivalent to the number of `#` marks in a traditional markdown title.

```tsx title="The title used for this section"
<Title 
    // Required string
    title="Title"
    // Optional string
    subtitle="A title component with some additional functionality."
    // 1-6, default: 1
    depth={3}
    // "ss-pro" | "mono" | "cormorant"
    // Default depends on depth
    font="ss-pro"
    // "fit" | "full", default: "full"
    width="full"
/>
```

### "Callouts"

```tsx
<Callout title={"This is a _note_ callout"} type="note">
If not foldable, this will be displayed directly and there won't be an icon.
</Callout>

<Callout title={"This is a **tip** callout"} type="tip" foldable>
Set 'foldable' to make the callout foldable.
</Callout>

<Callout title={"This is a **important** callout"} type="important" foldable folded={false}>
Set 'folded={false}' to start in an expanded state when 'foldable'
</Callout>

<Callout title={"This is a **warning** callout"} type="warning" foldable>
Set 'foldable' to make the callout foldable.
</Callout>

<Callout title={"This is a **caution** callout"} type="caution" foldable>

</Callout>

<Callout title={"This is a **Pine** callout"} type="pine" foldable>

</Callout>

<Callout title={"This is a **Fog** callout"} type="fog" foldable>

</Callout>

<Callout title={"This is a **Moss** callout"} type="moss" foldable>

</Callout>

<Callout title={"This is a **Cream** callout"} type="cream" foldable right>

</Callout>
```

<Callout title={"This is a _note_ callout"} type="note">
If not foldable, this will be displayed directly and there won't be an icon.
</Callout>

<Callout title={"This is a **tip** callout"} type="tip" foldable>
Set 'foldable' to make the callout foldable.
</Callout>

<Callout title={"This is a **important** callout"} type="important" foldable folded={false}>
Set `folded={false}` to start in an expanded state when 'foldable'
</Callout>

<Callout title={"This is a **warning** callout"} type="warning" foldable>
Set 'foldable' to make the callout foldable.
</Callout>

<Callout title={"This is a **caution** callout"} type="caution" foldable>
Set 'foldable' to make the callout foldable.
</Callout>

<Callout title={"This is a **Pine** callout"} type="pine" foldable>
Some content shown after opening!
</Callout>

<Callout title={"This is a **Mist** callout"} type="mist" foldable>
Some content shown after opening!
</Callout>

<Callout title={"This is a **Fog** callout"} type="fog" foldable>
Some content shown after opening!
</Callout>

<Callout title={"This is a **Moss** callout"} type="moss" foldable>
Some content shown after opening!
</Callout>

<Callout title={"This is a **Dust** callout"} type="dust" foldable>
Some content shown after opening!
</Callout>

<Callout title={"This is a **Matcha** callout"} type="matcha" foldable>
Some content shown after opening!
</Callout>

<Callout title={"This is a **Cream** callout"} type="cream" foldable right>
Some content shown after opening!
</Callout>

Or pass either `right` or `left` as a boolean to float the callout to that side when the screen is large enough and text will wrap around it.

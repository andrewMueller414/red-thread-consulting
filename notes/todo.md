# Red Thread Consulting To-Do List

- [x] Setup monaco editor to support shiki for syntax highlighting for it's mdx support.
- [x] Setup editor with solid theme provided by shiki that aligns with rest of app.
- [ ] Handle saving of mdx to database with keymap.
  - [ ] Show indicator to admin indicating that content was saved.
- [ ] Add 'view full page' option to table of results. This can be the same link that will be sendable to others.
- [ ] Implement side-by-side image grid component in mdx similar to layout used previously once image storage solutions are figured out.
- [ ] Setup markdown remark image plugin for better default image sizing if `prose` doesn't catch it.
- [ ] Render solid preview in same mdx form container that will be used elsewhere throughout the app.
- [ ] Fix response preview page to accomodate form of unknown format.

## Admin Improvements

- [ ] Handle authentication fail page and setup authentication page to redirect to our auth page. Currently it's redirecting to the default next-auth pages and they're hideous.

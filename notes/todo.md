# Red Thread Consulting To-Do List

- [ ] Setup monaco editor to support shiki for syntax highlighting for it's mdx support.
- [ ] Setup editor with solid theme provided by shiki that aligns with rest of app.
- [ ] Render solid preview in same mdx form container that will be used elsewhere throughout the app.
- [ ] Fix response preview page to accomodate form of unknown format.

## Admin Improvements

- [ ] Handle authentication fail page and setup authentication page to redirect to our auth page. Currently it's redirecting to the default next-auth pages and they're hideous.
